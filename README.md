#### How did the idea for the company (or project) come about? 
The idea came about by the desire to integrate AI into the architectural design process to improve design efficiency for “global sustainable development.” The founding partner, Juan Bordallo, has extensive experience in the architecture industry, as well as computer design and AI. (2)

#### How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
ARCHITEchTURES has received **$1.192 million** in funding from various sources since it’s incorporation. In 2018 it was been funded via See VC rounds, with investors including Neinor Homes, Bamboo Venture Capital, Yara Ventures, and more. Later in 2019, it received grant money with EIC as the lead investor. It again received VC investment in 2023. These various funding rounds indicate that ARCHITEChTURES has a diverse approach to funding. 

1. VC Seed Round | Jan 1, 2018 | **$841 K**
2. Grant | Jul 31, 2019 | **$55.7 K**
3. Later Stage VC | Jul 19, 2023 | **$300 K**

According to ARCHITEchTURES blog, they have also received funding from the following investors: (2)
    * CDTI: Centre for Technological and Industrial Development, part of the Ministry of Economy and Competition.
    * ERDF: the European Fund for Regional Development (the Fund for Technology).
    * ENISA: Spanish National Innovation Company.
    * ICO: State Credit Institution.

## Business Activities

#### What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve? 
ARCHITEchTURES’ goal is to improve architectural design efficiency by reducing redundant work and the time spent generating multiple design schemes based on a given set of data. The company’s website describes it’s tool as “a cloud platform for artificial intelligence-aided architectural design." Time spent designing is reduced because it generates the graphic and analytical documentation at the same time and is an online “Building Information Model” (BIM) tool.(6) This means data is interconnected in a way to output floor plans, renders, area schedules, area takeoffs, cost estimates, and energy efficiency calculations simultaneously. 
The project works in the following way: 
“...The design is developed by an intelligent system according to the user’s requirements. In this way we ask the AI for a series of criteria that the building must meet, and the AI returns design proposals that optimally meet our criteria, generating them in real time. In addition, we benefit from a high degree of process automation: area calculations, takeoffs or estimates are calculated in real time, floor plans and BIM models are done in a matter of minutes." (6)

#### Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers? 
Architects, designers, and real estate developers are the intended audience for this tool. It allows this set of customers to quickly iterate in the early stages of architectural design, setting future projects up for success. 

#### What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
Allegedly, ARCHITEchTURES “is the first company in the world to introduce GenAI in floor planning.”(7) This places the company on the leading edge of AI-assisted architectural design and a front-runner in the industry. The company created their AI tool in response to current difficulties of parametric design, including difficulty in scaling the functionality of a parametric design tool and inherent inflexibility of parametric design tools. “Deep Learning” overcomes this: 

> “This fact, which is a major barrier to the expansion of architectural design automation technologies, is what prompted a fundamental part of the development of our solution: our AI is born with the vocation of being able to be widely used in any market to effectively produce a global impact on the design process. This has led us to develop a technology based on Deep Learning that is able to learn to design buildings of any typology that can be found on an international scale." (8)

#### Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? 
ARCHITEchTURES uses Generative AI.(7) "Both Generative Design and Machine Learning involve aided design processes, i.e., we do not draw geometry manually, but ask a program to generate that geometry for us by introducing parameters and objective data." (7)

## Landscape

#### What field is the company in? 
ARCHITEchTURES is in the Architecture/Engineering/Construction (AEC) industry, and it is especially geared towards residential developers.

#### What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5 to 10 years?
During my time as an architect over the last decade, it was my responsibility to stay knowledge of the trends in my industry. Recent technology trends in the AEC industry include BIM, virtual reality, and augmented reality tools. Other topical trends in AEC include sustainability, Net Zero design, and resiliency. AI-assisted design began to trend in mid-2023 and continues to be a pain-point for companies, since there are a lot of unanswered legal questions around its use.

#### What are the other major companies in this field?
Other companies in this field, AI-assisted architectural design, include: Finch 3D, Hypar, Autodesk Forma, Delve, and Midjourney.


## Results

#### What has been the business impact of this company so far? 
ARCHITEchTURES has been adopted by several worldwide real estate developers and architects. It has been used by businesses of all sizes included freelancers and leading companies, including but not limited to: Larson & Toubro, Kajima Corporation, Neinor Homes, Realiza Arquitetura, isBIM, Asenjo y Asociados, Fundamenta, Constructora Bolivar, Perkins & Will, Rise Residential (9)

#### How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?
Based on funding information available publicly it performs better than similar companies with a similar type of genAI product, such as [Veras](https://www.evolvelab.io/veras). Veras raised $286K since 2016. (10)

It does not perform as well as better-known genAI image creation platforms such as [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/home). Midjourney is self-funded and has an annual recurring revenue of $200 million. (11) 
 
This is likely because Midjourney is a broad tool that can be used by a wider pool of users. Floor-plan generating software is a niche that is not widely applicable to industries and users outside of A/E/C industry. Howevery, while midjourney is used by architects for concept development, it is not a useful tool for floor plan generation. 

## Recommendations

#### If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
I would recommend that ARCHITEchTURES integrates regulatory information that is up to date, without requiring input from the users. The tool could scrape data from the internet or integrate with a database that contains that up-to-date information.

#### Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
This service would better streamlines the design process, creating efficiencies and less reliance on code consultants to advise the designers. In turn, it reduces the fee that architects charge clients because they can confidently include fewer consultants under their contract.

#### What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
This service could utilize machine learning to analyse floor plans, and compare those plans to regulatory requirements. Regulatory requirements are based on the design’s typology and geographic location, which would still be required as an input from the user. The user would also input the scale of the drawing (if the scale is not included on the drawing sheet), and flag areas that may not be compliant with regulations. 

#### Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
Machine learning is appropriate because the software needs to be trained on a given set of data (I.e. a library of floor plans) so that the software can be given a floor plan it has never seen before, and interpret parts of the images and make conclusions from those interpretations.
